\noindent After the CS170 project, you go to Las Vegas to celebrate. You buy $k$ tokens in the casino, and you are
playing the following game until you run out of tokens:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item At each turn the house chooses a color, \textsc{Green} or \textsc{Red}, and you try to guess the color.
\item If you guess wrong, you lose 1 token.
\item If you guess correctly, you keep your token, and the casino donates one dollar to your charity that you
founded.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent You have 1024 friends watching. On each turn, they all tell you what they think the next color will be. One of your friends can secretly see the future, and always guesses correctly, although you don't know which of your friends it is.

\vspace{4pt}\noindent How many tokens do you need in order to guarantee an infinite support for your charity? In other words, what should $k$ be so that you never run out of tokens?

\noindent Kanye West has gained access to the Facebook social graph. For years now, he has boasted of having the
largest, most impressive clique in the network, and now he wants to confirm this.

\vspace{4pt}\noindent As Kanye's social media advisor, you inform him that sadly, as the \textsc{clique} problem is \textbf{NP}-complete, there is little hope of being able to do this. "Fine," he says, "can we just find a clique of at least $\frac{|V|}4$ people?"

\vspace{4pt}\noindent Note: for the \textsc{clique} problem, you are given a graph $G$, and you want to find a clique of at least $k$ vertices, or return that no such clique exists.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item Prove that in fact, the \textsc{quarter-clique} problem (finding a clique of size at least $\frac{|V|}
4$) is also \textbf{NP}-complete.
\BeginSolution % 2(a)
% Solution Here

\EndSolution
\item Kanye is going to give an incorrect reduction. Give an instance of \textsc{Clique} for which Kanye's reduction gives the wrong answer, and explain why. Kanye is interested in another problem: "In my industry, musicians don't like to talk to one another. But we each talk to our various agents. Likewise, each agent may talk to many artists, but not to one another. Can I find $k$ musicians who all talk to $k$ agents, who in turn all talk to those same $k$ artists?"

Formally stated, we have the \textsc{clique with agents} problem:

\begin{addmargin}[0.75cm]{0cm}
Given a bipartite graph $G = (M \cup A,E)$ and a number $k$, find subsets $M' \subseteq M$ and $A' \subseteq A$,
$|M'| = |A'| = k$, such that $(m,a) \in E$ $\forall m \in M',a \in A'$. We call $M' \cup A'$ a \textit{biclique} of size $2k$.
\end{addmargin}

Kanye believes \textsc{clique with agents} is \textbf{NP}-hard. He proposes the following reduction:

\begin{addmargin}[0.75cm]{0cm}
"Reduce from \textsc{clique}. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a desired clique size $k$,
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Create a new bipartite graph $G' = (M,A,E')$, initially empty.
\item For each $v \in V$, add a musician $m_v$ to $M$ and an agent $a_v$ to $A$. Add an edge $(m_v,a_v)$ to $E'$.
\item For each $(u, v) \in E$, add edges $(a_u,m_v)$ and $(a_v,m_u)$ to $E'$.
\end{enumerate}

Then, if there is a size-$k$ clique in $G$, there will be a size-$2k$ biclique in $G'$. Conversely, if there is no $k$-clique in $G$, all bicliques in $G'$ are smaller than $2k$."

\noindent In the \textsc{multiway cut} problem, the input is an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a set of terminal nodes $s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_k \in V$. The goal is to find the minimum set of edges in $E$ whose removal leaves all terminals in different components.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time when $k = 2$.

\item Give an approximation with ratio at most 2 for the case $k = 3$. (Hint: use part a, your algorithm
shouldn't be too complicated)

\begin{myboxot}\noindent\textbf{$\star\star\star\star\star$ Level}\end{myboxot} 

\noindent The \textsc{metric traveling salesman} problem is the special case of TSP in which the edge lengths form a \textit{metric}, which satisfies the triangle inequality and other properties (review section 9.2.2). In class, we saw a 2-approximation algorithm for this problem, which works by building a minimum spanning tree.

\vspace{2pt}\noindent Here is another heuristic for metric TSP:
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\vspace{-10pt}\State Summary: maintain a current \textit{subtour} $\tau$ on a subset of $V$, then expand it to include all nodes in $G$
\vspace{12pt}\Function{TSP-Local-Merge}{complete undirected graph $G = (V, E, \ell)$ with metric distance}
\Let {$\tau$}{$[v_1, v_2]$ where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the closest pair of nodes in $G$}
\While{$|\tau|<|V|$}
\Let {$v_i, v_j$}{$v_i, v_j$ such that $v_i \in \tau, v_j \in \{V \setminus \tau\},(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $l(v_i, v_j)$ is minimized}
\State Modify $\tau$ by inserting $v_j$ immediately after $v_i$
\EndWhile
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\noindent Prove that the above "local merging" algorithm also approximates metric TSP to a factor of 2.

\vspace{4pt}\noindent \textit{Hint: Note the similarity between this algorithm and Prim's.}

\vspace{4pt}\noindent Clarification: $\tau$ is the list of cities to visit, in order.

code, writeup, and output file submissions will be due at the same time as the next homework!

\vspace{4pt}\noindent Explain on the high level how your phase II algorithm works, or how you plan for it to work. Give some estimates and justifications for how long it will take to solve 300 instances.
